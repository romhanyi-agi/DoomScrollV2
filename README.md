# DoomScrollV2

An Among Us mod designed by [Gary Wells](https://github.com/WellsGA). 
- Find the original project repo here: https://github.com/WellsGA/Doom-Scroll-Among-Us-mod
- And a later version that doesn't use Reactor: https://github.com/WellsGA/Doom-Scroll

In this version, I only included my code and some solutions are different from our original ones.

## Used frameworks and libraries
- To load the mod, I use [Bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx), a Unity / XNA game patcher, and a plugin framework.
- I also utilize [Harmoy2](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), a library for patching, replacing, and decorating .NET and Mono methods during runtime.
- ~~In the first version, I used [Reactor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor), a modding API for Among Us.~~
